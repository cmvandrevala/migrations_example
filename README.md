# Migrations Example

This repo contains a simple script that executes a set of database migrations in Postgres (the SQL files).

The command ```./migrate.sh up``` will build the database.

The command ```./migrate.sh``` will drop the database.

This script is ONLY for learning purposes. It is woefully underpowered for any environment outside of a classroom.

__Don't use it in production!!!__
